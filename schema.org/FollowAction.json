  "description": "The act of forming a personal connection with someone/something (object) unidirectionally/asymmetrically to get updates polled from.\n\nRelated actions:\n\n\nBefriendAction: Unlike BefriendAction, FollowAction implies that the connection is not necessarily reciprocal.\nSubscribeAction: Unlike SubscribeAction, FollowAction implies that the follower acts as an active agent constantly/actively polling for updates.\nRegisterAction: Unlike RegisterAction, FollowAction implies that the agent is interested in continuing receiving updates from the object.\nJoinAction: Unlike JoinAction, FollowAction implies that the agent is interested in getting updates from the object.\nTrackAction: Unlike TrackAction, FollowAction refers to the polling of updates of all aspects of animate objects rather than the location of inanimate objects (e.g. you track a package, but you don't follow it).",
